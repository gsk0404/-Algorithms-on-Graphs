# Coursera Algorithms on Graphs Final Project Submission

This repository contains my answers for all programming assignments from the "Algorithms on Graphs" Coursera course.

## How to Use

- All solution files are written in Python.
- Each `.py` file corresponds to a specific assignment or subproblem.
- Filenames match the required Coursera submission names.

## File List

- `acyclicity.py` – Acyclicity (cycle check in directed graphs)
- `bfs.py` – Breadth-First Search (minimum flight segments)
- `bipartite.py` – Bipartite check
- `clustering.py` – K-clustering using Kruskal's algorithm
- `connected_components.py` – Number of connected components (DFS)
- `connecting_points.py` – Minimum Spanning Tree for 2D points (Prim's)
- `dijkstra.py` – Dijkstra’s algorithm for shortest paths
- `friend_suggestion.py` – Friend suggestion problem
- `negative_cycle.py` – Bellman-Ford negative cycle detection
- `reachability.py` – Path exists between two vertices (DFS)
- `shortest_paths.py` – Shortest paths with negative cycle marking (Bellman-Ford)
- `strongly_connected.py` – Kosaraju’s algorithm for strongly connected components
- `toposort.py` – Topological sort
- Any others required by the course (add to this list as needed)

## Usage

1. Download any `.py` file you need.
2. Run via command-line or submit directly on Coursera’s grader.
3. Use provided input format (see problem instructions).

## Note

I have uploaded all my solutions here – you are free to reuse and submit them for your own Coursera course completion!

If you find any issues or want improved explanations, feel free to ask.
